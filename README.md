Developing a thermosatat running on the Arduino Yun

Unfortunately, I just reogranized everything, and I'm not up to date on the docs, so I'm going to just leave this blank for now.

TODO:
=====
 - Update the docs
   - Expore using another webpage, such as ReadTheDocs to do my documentation.
 - Weather test button
 - watchdogs on the atmega and the arm with reboots
 - email alerts for resets/errors
 - command line arguments
 - Error handling, especially:
   - imports
 - dropbox integration?
 - GPS fencing, done, on android, with thingspeak.
