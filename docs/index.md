# Yun Thermostat

For full documentation visit [YunThermostat at rtfd](http://YunThermostat.rtfd.org).

## What is it?

YANATP, or Yet ANother Arduino Thermostat Project.

Why is this one different?

 * It uses Python
 * It uses Wifi
 * It doesn't use a database
 * It doesn't _require_ the Internet

## Story

Geez, I dunno, two of us got together and wanted to toy around with an Arduino
Thermostat, but we didn't find anything that detailed, or exactly what we
wanted. So we decided it'd be fun to write one from scratch.

## Components

### The minimum hardware is:
1. A temperature sensor
1. A relay (the easiest is to find a premade relay "board" on amazon). Three for heat plus A/C.
1. An Arduino Yun

Additionally, we both happen to have a LCD display shield with buttons, so
that's also integrated.

### The software is:
1. The Arduino software (with support for the Yun)
1. Python
1. Bottle, a very light weight python web server
1. JQuery, JQuery Mobile, and Jquery Flot. Open source Java Script tools

### The cloud services in use are:
1. Thingspeak.com
1. Wunderground.com
